This is the Solo project, which is an app that displays the weather wherever the user happened to be. I implemented the following user stories:
User can view the weather in his/her current location.
Weather icon will change depending on weather conditions.
User can search for weather information of other places also.
weekly, daily and hourly weather reports.
data on humidity, feels like, as well as the current time of location,
built-in map allowing users to monitor the weather in a particular region or a specific country in real-time.
